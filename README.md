### How to run it on your own machine

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

2. Add LLM_GEMINI_KEY key to `.env` file:

   ```plaintext
   LLM_GEMINI_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Run the application

   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

4. (Occasionally) Export uv lockfile to requirements.txt:

This ensures that streamlit picks up the correct versions of dependencies when
you deploy or share your app.

   ```bash
   uv export --format requirements-txt --output-file requirements.txt
   ```
